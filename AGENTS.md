# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open-source reference stack for running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) always-on assistants inside [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) sandboxes more safely. It provides CLI tooling, a blueprint for sandbox orchestration, and security hardening.

**Status:** Alpha (March 2026+). Interfaces may change without notice.

## Agent Skills

This repo ships agent skills under `.agents/skills/`, organized into three audience buckets: `nemoclaw-user-*` (end users), `nemoclaw-maintainer-*` (project maintainers), and `nemoclaw-contributor-*` (codebase contributors). Load the `nemoclaw-skills-guide` skill for a full catalog and quick decision guide mapping tasks to skills.

## Architecture

| Path | Language | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `bin/` | JavaScript (CJS) | CLI launcher (`nemoclaw.js`) and small compatibility helpers |
| `src/lib/` | TypeScript | Core CLI logic: onboard, credentials, inference, policies, preflight, runner |
| `nemoclaw/` | TypeScript | Plugin project (Commander CLI extension for OpenClaw) |
| `nemoclaw/src/blueprint/` | TypeScript | Runner, snapshot, SSRF validation, state management |
| `nemoclaw/src/commands/` | TypeScript | Slash commands, migration state |
| `nemoclaw/src/onboard/` | TypeScript | Onboarding config |
| `nemoclaw-blueprint/` | YAML | Blueprint definition and network policies |
| `nemoclaw-blueprint/model-specific-setup/` | JSON | Agent-scoped model/provider compatibility registry |
| `scripts/` | Bash/JS/TS | Install helpers, setup, automation, E2E tooling |
| `test/` | JavaScript (ESM) | Root-level integration tests (Vitest) |
| `test/e2e/` | Bash/JS/TS | End-to-end tests, scenario-based runner (see `test/e2e/README.md`) |
| `docs/` | MDX/Markdown | User-facing docs (Fern MDX plus legacy MyST source during migration) |
| `fern/` | YAML/CSS/SVG | Fern site configuration and shared assets |

| Serve docs locally | `npm run docs:live` |

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Dual-Language Stack

- **CLI and plugin**: TypeScript (`src/`, `nemoclaw/src/`) with a small CommonJS launcher in `bin/`; ESM in `test/`
- **Blueprint**: YAML configuration (`nemoclaw-blueprint/`)
- **Docs**: Fern MDX for migrated pages; legacy MyST Markdown remains during the transition for generated skills and parity checks
- **Tooling scripts**: Bash and Python

The `bin/` directory uses CommonJS intentionally for the launcher and a few compatibility helpers so the CLI still has a stable executable entry point. The main CLI implementation lives in `src/` and compiles to `dist/`. The `nemoclaw/` plugin uses TypeScript and requires compilation.

### Testing Strategy

Tests are organized into three Vitest projects defined in `vitest.config.ts`:

1. **`cli`** — `test/**/*.test.{js,ts}` — integration tests for CLI behavior
2. **`plugin`** — `nemoclaw/src/**/*.test.ts` — unit tests co-located with source
3. **`e2e-branch-validation`** — `test/e2e/brev-e2e.test.ts` — validates a branch from source on ephemeral Brev instance (requires `BREV_API_TOKEN`)

When writing tests:

- Root-level tests (`test/`) use ESM imports
- Plugin tests use TypeScript and are co-located with their source files
- Mock external dependencies; don't call real NVIDIA APIs in unit tests
- E2E tests run on ephemeral Brev cloud instances

### Security Model

NemoClaw isolates agents inside OpenShell sandboxes with:

- Network policies (`nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/`) controlling egress
- Credential sanitization to prevent leaks
- SSRF validation (`nemoclaw/src/blueprint/ssrf.ts`)
- Docker capability drops and process limits

Security-sensitive code paths require extra test coverage.

## Code Style and Conventions

### Commit Messages

Conventional Commits required. Enforced by commitlint via prek `commit-msg` hook.

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `merge`

### SPDX Headers

Every source file must include an SPDX license header. The pre-commit hook auto-inserts them:

```javascript
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

For shell scripts use `#` comments. For Markdown use HTML comments.

### JavaScript

- `bin/` launcher and remaining `scripts/*.js`: **CommonJS** (`require`/`module.exports`), Node.js 22.16+
- `test/`: **ESM** (`import`/`export`)
- Biome config in `biome.json`
- Keep function complexity low; existing complexity hotspots are tracked separately
- Unused vars pattern: prefix with `_`

### TypeScript

- Plugin code in `nemoclaw/src/` is linted and formatted by the root Biome config
- CLI type-checking via `tsconfig.cli.json`
- Plugin type-checking via `nemoclaw/tsconfig.json`

### Shell Scripts

- ShellCheck enforced (`.shellcheckrc` at root)
- `shfmt` for formatting
- All scripts must have shebangs and be executable

### No External Project Links

Do not add links to third-party code repositories, community collections, or unofficial resources. Links to official tool documentation (Node.js, Python, uv) are acceptable.

## Git Hooks (prek)

All hooks managed by [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (installed via `npm install`):

| Hook | What runs |
|------|-----------|
| **pre-commit** | File fixers, formatters, linters, Vitest (plugin) |
| **commit-msg** | commitlint (Conventional Commits) |
| **pre-push** | TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit for plugin, JS, CLI) |

## Working with This Repo

### Before Making Changes

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full contributor guide
2. Run `make check` to verify your environment is set up correctly
3. Check that `npm test` passes before starting

### Common Patterns

**Adding a CLI command:**

- Entry point: `bin/nemoclaw.js` (launches the compiled CLI in `dist/`)
- Main CLI implementation lives in `src/lib/` and compiles to `dist/lib/`
- Add tests in `test/`

**Adding a plugin feature:**

- Source: `nemoclaw/src/`
- Co-locate tests as `*.test.ts`
- Build with `cd nemoclaw && npm run build`

**Adding a network policy preset:**

- Add YAML to `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/presets/`
- Follow existing preset structure (see `slack.yaml`, `discord.yaml`)

**Adding model-specific sandbox compatibility:**

- Add a declarative manifest under `nemoclaw-blueprint/model-specific-setup/<agent>/`
- Use one exact `agent` per manifest (`openclaw`, `hermes`, etc.); do not make shared multi-agent manifests
- Put OpenClaw executable wrappers under `nemoclaw-blueprint/openclaw-plugins/`
- Put Hermes executable wrappers under `agents/hermes/`
- Keep `agents/hermes/generate-config.ts` as a thin build-time entrypoint; add Hermes env parsing, config construction, registry handling, and serialization under `agents/hermes/config/`
- Do not add Hermes behavior for an OpenClaw issue without a Hermes-specific repro or acceptance test

### Gotchas

- `npm install` at root triggers `prek install` which sets up git hooks. If hooks fail, check that `core.hooksPath` is unset: `git config --unset core.hooksPath`
- The `nemoclaw/` subdirectory has its own `package.json` and `node_modules`, while sharing the root Biome config — it's a separate npm project
- SPDX headers are auto-inserted by pre-commit hooks; don't worry about adding them manually
- Coverage thresholds are ratcheted in `ci/coverage-threshold-*.json` — new code should not decrease CLI or plugin coverage
- The `.claude/skills` symlink points to `.agents/skills` — both paths resolve to the same content

## Documentation

- Source of truth: `docs/` directory
- `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-user-*/*.md` is **autogenerated** — never edit directly
- User skills are generated agent-skill packages, prefixed with `nemoclaw-user-*`, that help AI agents guide end users through NemoClaw workflows.
- For normal docs changes, include only the source pages under `docs/`; the docs-to-skills hook runs in dry-run mode to validate generated output.
- Follow style guide in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Release prep only:** During release prep, run `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs`, make doc version bumps, regenerate user skills, then open the docs refresh PR with both docs and generated user skills.

## PR Requirements

- Create feature branch from `main`
- Run `make check` and `npm test` before submitting
- Follow PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Update docs for any user-facing behavior changes
- No secrets, API keys, or credentials committed
- Limit open PRs to fewer than 10
