# NemoClaw on DGX Spark

> **WIP** — This page is actively being updated as we work through Spark installs. Expect changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** (pre-installed, v28.x)
- **Node.js 22** (installed by the install.sh)
- **OpenShell CLI** (installed via the Quick Start steps below)
- **NVIDIA API Key** from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) — prompted on first run

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install OpenShell:
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | sh

# Clone NemoClaw:
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw.git
cd NemoClaw

# Spark-specific setup
sudo ./scripts/setup-spark.sh

# Install NemoClaw using the NemoClaw/install.sh:
./install.sh

# Alternatively, you can use the hosted install script:
curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
```

## What's Different on Spark

DGX Spark ships **Ubuntu 24.04 + Docker 28.x** but no k8s/k3s. OpenShell embeds k3s inside a Docker container, which hits two problems on Spark:

### 1. Docker permissions

```text
Error in the hyper legacy client: client error (Connect)
  Permission denied (os error 13)
```

**Cause**: Your user isn't in the `docker` group.
**Fix**: `setup-spark` runs `usermod -aG docker $USER`. You may need to log out and back in (or `newgrp docker`) for it to take effect.

### 2. cgroup v2 incompatibility

```text
K8s namespace not ready
openat2 /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods/pids.max: no
Failed to start ContainerManager: failed to initialize top level QOS containers
```

**Cause**: Spark runs cgroup v2 (Ubuntu 24.04 default). OpenShell's gateway container starts k3s, which tries to create cgroup v1-style paths that don't exist. The fix is `--cgroupns=host` on the container, but OpenShell doesn't expose that flag.

**Fix**: `setup-spark` sets `"default-cgroupns-mode": "host"` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restarts Docker. This makes all containers use the host cgroup namespace, which is what k3s needs.

## Manual Setup (if setup-spark doesn't work)

### Fix Docker cgroup namespace

```bash
# Check if you're on cgroup v2
stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/
# Expected: cgroup2fs

# Add cgroupns=host to Docker daemon config
sudo python3 -c "
import json, os
path = '/etc/docker/daemon.json'
d = json.load(open(path)) if os.path.exists(path) else {}
d['default-cgroupns-mode'] = 'host'
json.dump(d, open(path, 'w'), indent=2)
"

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Fix Docker permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker  # or log out and back in
```

### Then run the onboard wizard

```bash
nemoclaw onboard
```

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| cgroup v2 kills k3s in Docker | Fixed in `setup-spark` | `daemon.json` cgroupns=host |
| Docker permission denied | Fixed in `setup-spark` | `usermod -aG docker` |
| CoreDNS CrashLoop after setup | Fixed in `fix-coredns.sh` | Uses container gateway IP, not 127.0.0.11 |
| Image pull failure (k3s can't find built image) | OpenShell bug | `openshell gateway destroy && openshell gateway start`, re-run setup |
| GPU passthrough | Untested on Spark | Should work with `--gpu` flag if NVIDIA Container Toolkit is configured |

## Verifying Your Install

```bash
# Check sandbox is running
openshell sandbox list
# Should show: nemoclaw  Ready

# Test the agent
openshell sandbox connect nemoclaw
# Inside sandbox:
nemoclaw-start openclaw agent --agent main --local -m 'hello' --session-id test

# Monitor network egress (separate terminal)
openshell term
```

## Architecture Notes

```text
DGX Spark (Ubuntu 24.04, cgroup v2)
  └── Docker (28.x, cgroupns=host)
       └── OpenShell gateway container
            └── k3s (embedded)
                 └── nemoclaw sandbox pod
                      └── OpenClaw agent + NemoClaw plugin
```
