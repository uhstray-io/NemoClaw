 * Before #3456 this was a hard-coded `nemoclaw <name> destroy --yes` line
 * with a literal `<name>` placeholder — not actionable when the registry was
 * empty (the State A / State B dead loop the reporter hit on six Linux
 * hosts). This helper renders the right shape based on what's actually
 * registered AND owns the registry lookup, so the onboard.ts callsite stays

 *
 * Empty / null input means no sandboxes are registered locally; onboard has
 * already tried the safe stale-gateway replacement path, so the manual fallback
 * should target gateway cleanup instead of a full uninstall. A single
 * registered sandbox gets one destroy line with `--cleanup-gateway` so the
 * gateway also goes away (otherwise destroy preserves the shared gateway by
 * default — see v0.0.39 release notes). Multiple sandboxes get one destroy
 * line each; only the last carries `--cleanup-gateway` so the gateway lives
 * until every sandbox is gone.
