/**
 * Host-level TCP readiness probe for the OpenShell Docker-driver gateway.
 *
 * Plain TCP connect to the local gateway endpoint — semantic-free, just asks
 * "is anyone listening?". Used by `startDockerDriverGateway` in `onboard.ts`
 * to gate the "✓ Docker-driver gateway is healthy" log against the class of
 * bug reported in #3111, where the openshell-gateway binary crashed on
 * startup but metadata-based health checks (isGatewayHealthy) still
 * returned true because:
 *
 *   - `isPidAlive` (`process.kill(pid, 0)`) returns true for zombies;
 *   - `registerDockerDriverGatewayEndpoint` is metadata-only
 *     (`openshell gateway add --local`) and doesn't probe the endpoint;
 *   - `isGatewayHealthy` is a string match on `openshell status` /
 *     `openshell gateway info` output, not a live probe.
 *
 * ## Why TCP and not HTTP
 *
 * There is a peer module `gateway-http-readiness.ts` (introduced by #3312)
 * that exposes `isGatewayHttpReady` — a stronger HTTP-level probe used on
 * the K3s path. It cannot be reused on the Docker-driver path because the
 * two gateway types expose different HTTP routes for the root path:
 *
 *   - K3s gateway answers `GET /` with 200/401 via a dispatcher catch-all.
 *   - Docker-driver gateway returns 404 for `GET /`; only routes under
 *     `/openshell.v1.OpenShell/*` (gRPC-over-HTTP) are served.
 *
 * Using the HTTP probe against a running Docker-driver gateway therefore
 * always fails the `{200, 401}` whitelist, which was the regression the
 * e2e-advisor caught in the first attempt at a shared fix.
 *
 * A plain TCP probe is sufficient for detecting #3111's failure mode
 * (crashed binary → nothing listening → TCP fails) without making
 * assumptions about HTTP route shape.
 *
 * ## Prior art in the codebase
 *
 * `isLocalForwardReachable` in
 * `src/lib/actions/sandbox/process-recovery.ts` (added by #3385) does a
 * similar TCP probe for the sandbox-forward domain, but spawns a child
 * node process per probe and is intentionally private to that module.
 * The two helpers serve different domains (onboard gateway vs. sandbox
 * forward) and have different sync/async requirements, but a future
 * unified "port liveness probe" API could subsume both. Tracked in #3213
 * (unified advisory / probe registry).

 *
 * @param port      Gateway port. Defaults to `GATEWAY_PORT` so normal call

 * @param timeoutMs Per-connect timeout. Clamped to a 50 ms minimum so the

 *                  passes 0.
