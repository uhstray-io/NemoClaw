// Post-upgrade stale-file cleanup.
//
// As NemoClaw evolves, host-side state migrates: older versions wrote files
// under the user's home that newer versions no longer use. Each entry in
// STALE_FILES owns the safety logic for one specific stale file and reports
// back when it actually removed something. The runner invokes them all once
// during the onboard completion path so a fresh post-upgrade onboard sweeps
// every leftover in a single uniform pass. Adding a future cleanup is one
// entry on STALE_FILES; the loop does not change. If a future leftover is a
// folder or symlink instead of a file, widen the shape at that point.
