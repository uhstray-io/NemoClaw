# Tunnel and host services

This folder contains host-side service lifecycle helpers used by `nemoclaw start`,
`nemoclaw stop`, and tunnel/port-forward related commands. Keep oclif parser glue
in `src/commands/**`; service orchestration that starts or stops host processes
belongs here or in `src/lib/actions/**` when it is command-specific.
